# RDS-Simulation

In this repo there is code to simulated RDS on a population of 2 subgroups with certain population sizes, homophily and (size-biased) degree distributions.
The methods used are 1: standard RDS. 2: RDS where recruits tell the type of links that they have. 3: same a 2 but they will recruit a person of the other type if possible.
The file which does this is RDS_Simulation.py. The file h_1_ests_plot.py is to plot the variances of the certain methods based on the simulations.

I believe the code speaks for itself. When running into problems, you can always message me through github.
